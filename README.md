This repository contains a security evaluation of LA County's Interactive Sample Ballot (ISB) program (https://isb.lavote.net/). This evaluation was created for [EECS 498.5/598.16: Election Cybersecurity](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs498.005/) at University of Michigan taught by Professor [J. Alex Halderman](https://jhalderm.com/).

A copy of the evaluation can be found in *report.pdf* and a copy of the ISB website files are included as well. To not disrupt service or scare county election officials, we cloned the website for independent evaluation. Our copy of the website can still be found at https://isb.wolvsec.org.

You can use the address of "1431 Pasqualito Dr San Marino 91108" to generate a sample ballot on our cloned site.
